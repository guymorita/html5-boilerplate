    <h1>PRIVACY POLICY</h1>

    <p>EFFECTIVE NOVEMBER 16, 2016</p>

    <h4>PRIVACY AND SECURITY</h4>

    <p>The statement below outlines the Wing Privacy Policy. Wing may update its Privacy Policy to reflect changes in the products and services that Wing offers, however, the underlying goal of protecting user privacy remains the same. By using Wing's service,
        each user consents to the collection, use or disclosure of their Personal Information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Your continued use of the Wing service following the "last-revised" date on this Privacy Policy will represent your consent
        to the collection, use or disclosure of your Personal Information under this Privacy Policy as modified. You are advised to review this page regularly for any changes.</p>

    <p>If users have questions or concerns regarding this statement, or feel that Wing has not complied with the Policy, they should first contact support [at] heywing [dot] com</p>

    <h4>STORAGE AND USE OF USER INFORMATION</h4>

    <p>Wing stores information as described below that could be used to identify users ("Personal Information") on the Wing servers for the sole purpose of providing the Wing service to users. Wing also stores certain non-personally identifiable information
        using log files.</p>

    <p>The following paragraph describes the Personal Information collected on Wing servers: email address, name and mailing address, telephone number, payment and usage records.</p>

    <h4>ELIGIBILITY</h4>

    <p>Wing does not intentionally collect or use personal information about individuals under the age of 13. Consequently, use of this web and mobile internet site and all related services by children under the age of 13 is strictly prohibited. Wing reserves
        the right to delete, move, edit, refuse to post or take other appropriate action with respect to any messages, information or files which Wing, in its sole discretion, deems objectionable or otherwise in violation of the terms and conditions of
        this Agreement.</p>

    <h4>AGGREGATE INFORMATION</h4>

    <p>Wing may use users' Personal Information to generate aggregated information that does not allow the user to be personally identified or contacted. Aggregated Information shows user activity as a whole rather than on an individual basis and may be
        used by Wing to provide insight on the usage of the Wing services.</p>

    <p>Wing allows third-party companies to serve ads and/or collect certain anonymous information when you visit our web site or mobile applications. These companies may use non-personally identifiable information (e.g., click stream information, browser
        type, time and date, subject of advertisements clicked or scrolled over) during your visits to this and other Web sites or mobile applications in order to provide advertisements about goods and services likely to be of greater interest to you.
        These companies typically use a cookie or third party web beacon to collect this information. To learn more about this behavioral advertising practice or to opt-out of this type of advertising, you can visit networkadvertising.org.</p>

    <h4>WEB AND MOBILE INTERNET SITE ACTIVITY</h4>

    <p>Like most standard Web and mobile internet sites and mobile applications, Wing stores and uses web server log files. These files include anonymous information about web browsers, such as internet protocol (IP) addresses, browser type, internet service
        provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, platform type, date/time stamp, and number of clicks to analyze trends, administer the site, track users' movement in the aggregate, and gather broad demographic information for aggregate use. Such log files
        are not linked to Personal Information through the Wing service.</p>

    <h4>SHARING</h4>

    <p>Wing will not share any information provided by users, except as follows:</p>

    <p><strong>AGGREGATE INFORMATION (NON-PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE)</strong></p>

    <p>Wing may use users' Personal Information to generate aggregated information relating to activity on Wing-enabled products and services. This aggregate information does not allow the user to be personally identified or contacted and shows user activity
        as a whole rather than on an individual basis. This information is shared with relevant Wing customers and partners.</p>

    <p><strong>WHEN Wing DISCLOSES USER INFORMATION</strong></p>

    <p>Wing may share users' Personal Information with its affiliates, subsidiaries and service providers for the sole purpose of providing the Wing service to the user, provided that the information is required for and used only for such purpose and provided
        the information is used in accordance with this Privacy Policy. Wing will otherwise only release Personal Information to third parties in the following limited circumstances: (i) if a law, regulation, search warrant, subpoena or court order legally
        requires Wing to do so; (ii) if Wing's rights or property or the rights or property of Wing's affiliates, subsidiaries, service providers or the users of Wing's web site, mobile applications or services are in jeopardy; or (iii) if the personal
        safety of users of Wing's web site, mobile applications or services or other members of the public is in jeopardy.</p>

    <p><strong>BUSINESS TRANSITIONS</strong></p>

    <p>In the event Wing goes through a business transition, such as a merger, being acquired by another company, or selling a portion of its assets, users' Personal Information will, in most instances, be one of the assets transferred.</p>

    <h4>LINKS</h4>

    <p>This Web or mobile internet site or mobile application contains links to other sites. Please be aware that Wing is not responsible for the privacy practices of such other sites. Wing encourages its users to be aware when they leave Wing products and
        to read the privacy statements of each and every Web site that collects Personal Information. This privacy statement applies solely to information collected by the Wing web and internet mobile site and mobile application.</p>

    <h4>SECURITY</h4>

    <p>Wing employs security measures in order to prevent the loss, misuse, unauthorized access, theft and alteration of Personal Information under Wing's control. However, no transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be completely secure. Consequently,
        Wing, its affiliates, subsidiaries, service providers and their respective officers, directors, employees and agents do not represent, warrant or guarantee that Personal Information will be protected against misuse, loss or alterations and do
        not accept any liability for Personal Information submitted to or collected by them nor for your or third parties' use or misuse of Personal Information.</p>

    <h4>NOTIFICATION OF CHANGES</h4>
